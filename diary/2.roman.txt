Great, great Grandma was alive and well in the 1800’s. Among her many other chores, she cared for a flock of chickens. In return, the chickens provided lots of eggs that Grandma sold in town for an important additional income.

Chickens are foragers. As a group they roam far and wide in search of fresh greens, proteins and scraps. Chickens even bring themselves home every evening just before dark to roost inside the hen house at night.

One warm spring day Grandma’s chicken flock discovered some juicy liquid seeping out from under the silo. This juice was the melting grains and greens that been fermenting all winter. The chickens found the silage juice very much to their liking and drank their fill. Then, being so stuffed with all that juice, the chickens slowly waddled back in the direction of their coop, but most of them didn’t make it all the way.
